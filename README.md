 This is my "Pomodoro Clock" project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock).

This project took me about 8.5 hours in total, 1.5 hours for designing, and 3.5 hours creating it with HTML, CSS (less), and 3.5 hours writing the Javascript functionality. Of course I used adobe XD to design it, and you can [download my project file here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7ArzBuNX7W9aGt5OUg0eEo3WDA).

As always, any feedback is appreciated.
